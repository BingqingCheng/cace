# Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (CACE)

## Summary

The Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion (CACE) is a new approach for developing machine learning interatomic potentials. This method utilizes Cartesian coordinates to provide a complete description of atomic environments, maintaining interaction body orders. It integrates low-dimensional embeddings of chemical elements with inter-atomic message passing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)
